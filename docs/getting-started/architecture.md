Astrysk has been designed to allow for extensibility through applets. Applets are self-contained applications that can provide additonal functionality and customisation options. These applets, developed in part by the community fosters a rich eco-system of tools and features to enhance the user experience.

An applet has a well defined interface that the main application can use to initialise the applet. The interface consists of 6 main screens:
- Home [Required]
- Search [Required]
- Settings [Required]
- Detail
- Modal
- Fullscreen Modal

The applet interface also has two other major functions;
- Configure
- Context Menu (For the persistent applet icon)
